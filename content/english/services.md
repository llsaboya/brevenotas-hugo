## Instructional Design & Business Analysis

Business analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the needs and challenges of an organization. By using the ADDIE process and value clarification, it is possible to identify the knowledge and skill gaps of a particular group. From there, it is possible to develop an action plan that meets the demands of the company, creating experiences that promote the development of reflective attitudes and effective practices in problem situations.

## Team Development

One of the biggest challenges in creating instructional projects is to form a highly skilled and professional team. That's why we work with subject matter experts (SMEs) to create a solid foundation for the project, covering everything from graphic design to user experience (UX) and any specific objectives related to the company's area of operation.

## Need Identification

At the beginning of each project, our role is to identify the needs and discover how to challenge the professionals' ability, making them establish relationships and see more than one way to achieve results.

## Experience and Competence

We, from the business analysis team, have extensive experience and competence to meet the demands of organizations. We have a history of working in different areas, from pre-university course monitoring to critical evaluations in advertising campaigns and 360 analyses in a financial institution.

## Adaptation to Changes

The business world is dynamic and constantly evolving. Organizations and their learning choices must be prepared to adapt to these changes. We, from the business analysis team, are ready to help your company develop and overcome market challenges.

## Organization Diagnostics

We offer customized solutions for each company, performing an accurate diagnostic of its needs and challenges. We work with effective methodologies to understand the needs and challenges of an organization. It is through this analysis that it is possible to identify the knowledge and skill gaps of a particular group, as well as develop a plan that meets the organization's needs.
