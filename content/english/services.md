Instructional design is the practice of creating experiences and learning materials that result in the real acquisition and applicability of knowledge and skills. The DI (instructional design) follows a system of assessment of real needs, elaboration of an objective process, development of instructional materials according to experts in the subject - in addition to the evaluation of its effectiveness.

I support businesses, entrepreneurs, students, teachers, instructional designers and anyone interested in creating more effective learning experiences by combining the art of creating engaging learning experiences with the science of how learning works.

### FAQ:
{{< collapse "Tell me about your design process." >}}
I consider the ADDIE model as a framework for the entire project. The template is a guideline for creating a decent learning solution that meets your business objective.

In some cases, to make a learning experience, I prefer to use the reverse design. This is an excellent approach to setting goals before developing the course.

{{< collapse "How do you work with Subject-Matter Expert (SMEs)?" >}}
Instructional designer (ID) can support the expert's opinion with data or research when needed. Some experts require time and information to trust instructional designers.

I like to explain my role and clarify my responsibilities at the beginning of the project. In a perfect world, I would call it cooperation. In the real world, ID and specialists need to negotiate and prioritize their decisions with focus on the student.

Also, I think sometimes experts can have this sixth sense about their craft, even if they aren't experts in andragogy. The main objective is to establish a good relationship based on trust.

{{< collapse "Do you work alone or with the team?" >}}
The instructional designer is not a generalist, but he is a specialist in how people learn. I believe that we can only make great ideas in good products if our team members are involved.

However, I am fully capable of working alone and developing learning experiences from the beginning till the end.

{{< collapse "How do you use technologies to design learning experiences?" >}}
Usually, before starting the creation process, I try to find out the full scale of the company's technological possibilities. According to the collected data, I suggest the ideas.

I don't think there is a single best learning tool, but We always can find the perfect one for your project.

{{< collapse "How would you work with limited resources?" >}}
There are very few situations where learning solutions have “enough time”, “enough resources” and “enough data”.

My way of conducting the needs analysis is to gather as much information as possible, using all sorts of methods. Implement a Design Thinking interview if you only have a few stakeholders. The use of surveys, focus groups, the “Map it” approach and many others are ideal solutions for these scenarios.
