# Harnessing the Power of Instructional Design to Drive Business Success

Instructional design is a crucial aspect of business success, as it helps organizations identify the knowledge and skill gaps within their workforce, and develop effective learning experiences that challenge and engage employees. At the heart of this discipline is the ADDIE process and Values Clarification, which are used to analyze business needs and develop comprehensive instructional design plans that meet the unique requirements of an organization.

As an instructional designer with a background in business management and a post-graduate degree in Instructional Design, I understand the challenges and complexities of this field. With a deep understanding of instructional design best practices, I work with subject matter experts (SMEs) to create learning experiences that drive positive change and help organizations achieve their goals.

One of the biggest challenges in instructional design is developing a professional team that can deliver the right learning process. That's why I work closely with SMEs to create strong foundations for the project, starting with graphic design and user experience (UX) and continuing through to any specific goals that are specific to your organization's area of expertise.

At the beginning of any project, I start by identifying the needs and goals of your organization and finding the best ways to challenge the capabilities of your professionals to help them establish better relationships and become more capable of seeing multiple ways to achieve results.

My passion for instructional design started during my undergraduate years, where I taught as a tutor to pay for my studies. I then worked in advertising and marketing, critically evaluating campaigns. For five years, I worked at the State Bank of Rio Grande do Sul (Banrisul), conducting "360 Analysis" of its network of customer service branches.

As the business world continues to evolve, so do organizations and their learning choices. With a proven track record in the field, I have the skills and experience necessary to drive successful instructional design projects and help your organization thrive.
