My name is **Lefebvre Saboya**. I have a postgraduate degree in instructional design and a degree in management processes. I use the ADDIE and Values Clarification process to analyze knowledge and skills gaps in a group. 

With Subject Matter Specialists (SMEs), I develop a plan that meets the needs of the organization, creating experiences that develop reflexive and practical attitudes in the face of problematic situations. 

Developing a professional team that delivers the right learning process is the main challenge of any instructional design project. 

That is why we work with Subject Matter Specialists (SMEs) to create solid foundations for the project, from graphic design, through user experience (UX) and any specific goal that is particular to your organization's ability. 

When starting a project, I develop the task of showing these needs and figuring out how to challenge the ability of professionals to be able to see more than one way to achieve the learning goals.
