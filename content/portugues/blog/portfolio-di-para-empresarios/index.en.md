## Overview 

This project showcases the capabilities **of The Articulate Rise 360** for informational materials. The challenge was to create an interaction that would explain what Instructional **Design is for** entrepreneurs who seek to implement this solution in their companies. 

Interviews with owners and entrepreneurs showed that they found it contradictory that instructional design professionals used traditional approaches when presenting their area - infographics, presentations and text - as they highlight their experience with new methodologies and technologies. 

Instructional design companies use various marketing and sales strategies. One of the main ones is *Lead Nurturing* (make the lead acquire knowledge and interact more with your brand). Even though instructional design has existed since the 1950s, "educating the customer" about the characteristics of instructional design, application scenarios and boundaries of action is still the focus of the Brazilian market. 

## Process 

### Needs analysis 

#### 1 - What changes do we want for the company?*

The interviewees said they were interested in the implementation of Instructional Design. However, these same entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs, accustomed to sales processes, would like to see the differential of Instructional Design from the start, including in the first contact. 

One of the respondents summarized as follows: 

>If Instructional Design were a product in a supermarket, what would a "free sample" be? 

The challenge was to include teaching design in the process, especially in lead nurturing strategy, since the goal of this marketing strategy resembles some learning goals in experiences developed by learning designers. 

#### 2 - What do people need to do to achieve this goal?

To achieve the goal of capturing customers, companies and DI designers use various marketing channels to show indicators, strategies, skills and data analysis. Practical applications, case studies and examples of development appear later in the process of nurturing, usually in the portfolio. 

The idea would be to develop a level 1 learning experience of interactivity, with two features: 

- Provide the first two levels of Bloom taxonomy: knowledge and understanding. 
- Passive level of eLearning interactivity, with clicks on interactivity, incorporating connections to recordings, podcasts, basic images and illustrations and avoiding test questions 

This activity would appear at the beginning of the process to demonstrate (albeit in a limited way) the use of learning design. 

### Informative eLearning production 

#### Development

Level 1 Interactivity allowed you to choose a more agile tool for production. In this project, we chose the Articulate Rise 360. Its features let you build responsive courses more easily. 

We use **Moore's motivational sequence** to organize the course topics. It was designed to be a sketch for persuasive lectures that move the audience toward a goal or decision. Each part of the course corresponds to the sequence, divided into five parts. 

- **Warning**: Hold attention immediately with a startling statement, a probing question or a moving story. 
- **Need**: Create interest by raising public awareness of a need or issue of self-interest. 
- **Satisfaction**: Show how the need can be met or met. You can build trust by showing that you have the answer to all known objections- for example, cost objections, time objections etc. 
- **Visualization**: Dramatically imagine the benefits to be gained. This will create a desire if you use motivations and emotions from the audience itself. 
- **Action**: Ask for a final decision or action.

Interactive elements are important in any course and represented a challenge in the project. Focusing on knowledge and understanding the target audience required greater fluidity of content. 

Activities and interactivity interrupt the flow of information transfer, so they are always used with a specific purpose in mind. We see interactivity as a demonstration of available resources, not evaluation tools to measure knowledge capture. 

For example, we use *click-to-reveal interactivity*, which used to be considered level *2 elements of interactivity*. However, we use this interactivity as at level 1 to generate the participant's reflection and identification with the proposed content. 

**Rise 360** is an agile authoring tool and already brings with it several animation elements, which makes it look more dynamic, as opposed to the monotony of reading a PowerPoint presentation, for example.

We received feedback in the final phase that part of the written content could be adapted for videos or animations. To validate this change we create **videos using Text-to-Speech.** We were surprised by the positive reaction to the tool. Although it does not replace professional narration in the final versions of the project, it is an important feature when used wisely. 

#### Design features

- **Content fluidity:** To create an experience of knowledge and understanding, the content's fluidity is essential not to overwhelm the participant. 
- **Dynamic visual elements** break the monotony of informational content. 
- **Storytelling** : We transform informational content into a journey told with the eyes of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs. We use Derek Gaunt's [**actionable techniques**](https://www.amazon.com.br/Ego-Authority-Failure-Intelligence-Negotiator-ebook/dp/B09TMVPYSY/) of *trust-based influence that* can motivate and inspire the participant. 
- **Text-to-Speech:** We use this tool during the video creation phase. While *text-to-speech* does not replace professional narration, it is a great tool for rapid prototyping and validation of concepts.

## Final reflection

The process of creating the **Leadership and Delegation Scenario** provided a unique experience by positioning itself on the boundary *between learning* *and content marketing*. It was necessary to avoid the pitfalls of setting up a *pitch deck* presentation and to take the learning experience. The main lessons for me were: 

- **Articulate Rise 360:** It is a powerful development tool with resourced and responsive assets. It fits best into fast deployment projects when design and interactivity does not require high levels of interaction or customization. 
- **Content research**: Working with instructional design subject matter (SME) experts, I was able to recall the complexity of researching, writing and reviewing the contents from the experts' point of *view*. Prioritizing information and providing it in a sequence other than the established one is a challenge: we need to clarify our (DI) choices and work with experts (SMEs) to create a solution that makes sense and is valued by the participant. 
- **Development deadline:** Rise 360, as a quick deployment solution, saves us time in the development phase of design solutions. However, depending on the needs of each stage, other phases continue with their deadlines. 
- **User Experience (UX):** Rise 360 makes the user experience enjoyable and dynamic. However, it is necessary to think about the course's structure to avoid interactivity that, even interesting from the design point of view, does not aggregate in the learning experience and can distract or overload the participant.
