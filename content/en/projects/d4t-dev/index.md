Imagine having access to the latest trends, research, and best practices in instructional design, all in one place. That's what our project aims to achieve. We're building a digital garden, a website that serves as a repository of information and knowledge about instructional design in Portuguese.

Our goal is to disseminate ideas and information about instructional design, enabling educators, instructional designers, students, and researchers to enhance their skills and practices. By translating important academic publications and materials from English to Portuguese, we're also breaking down the language barriers and increasing access to essential information.

The website is organized into categories and subcategories related to instructional design, allowing visitors to easily find the content they need. We use tags to connect related content, facilitating organic connections between ideas. Visitors can explore the digital garden non-linearly, following their interests and needs, and find reflection blocks and notation throughout the content.

To create relevant and evidence-based content, we monitor relevant sources, establish partnerships with experts and institutions, create original content, and regularly review and update content. We also promote collaboration and feedback, establish a publishing schedule, evaluate the impact of content, and invest in our own training and development.

We use tools like Hugo, Markdown, Git, GitHub/Netlify, Visual Studio Code, Google Analytics, SEO tools, Trello/Asana, Canva, Slack/Discord, and Google Docs to build and manage the site, collaborate, and monitor the impact of our work.

We believe our project will be a valuable resource for the instructional design community in Brazil, allowing professionals to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and research and enhance their practices. Join us in this journey of continuous learning and growth.
